
Development - Tasks to Complete
Problem 

You have a long list of tasks to get done today. Each task requires a certain amount of time. Some tasks can be done at the same time as others. Furthermore, some tasks must be executed at exact times. You can never do more than two tasks at the same time. Once you pick up a task, you must complete the task in its entirety (you cannot pick up a task, put it down, and resume it later). 

In the event a schedule cannot be made given the dataset given, your output should only read “Cannot make schedule: [simple description of why]”. 

Assume the earliest you’ll start your day is 7am. 

 
Goal 

You want to be done with your day as quickly as possible so you can plop down on the couch and catch an Arrested Development rerun. Do your best to write an algorithm that gets as many reruns in as possible. 

 
Input 

The file tasks_to_complete.yml, which contains the following information: 

    A list of tasks that must be completed 
    How long each takes, in minutes, 
    The required start time if there is one.  

    The compatibility with other tasks 

We will provide one example file but it is important that your project continues to work for other ymls which hold to the same schema. 

 
Output 

Your program should output, sorted by start time, then end time, the list of tasks executed: 

Sweep Floors,0700-0715 

Make Breakfast,0700-0730 

Make Coffee,0715-0720 

Eat Breakfast,0730-0800
